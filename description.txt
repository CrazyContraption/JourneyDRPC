Welcome to Journey's End Discord Rich Presence! - Last Updated 10/10/2021


This mod provides seamless rich presence data for your Discord "playing" status for TML Terraria 1.4.

This mod is a client-side mode, so you can play on any server with it, and the server will not disable or stop this mod from running.

If the rich presence isn't showing up on your profile, ensure that your activity status is on, and tModloader is added as a game.


FEATURES:
 - Displays the active biome, bosses, and other locational and situational information of your player.
 - Shows your life, mana, defence, and even your team!
 - Shows if you're playing solo, or on a server, and auto-generates a group of Discord users also using the mod on the same server!
 - No sign-in/authentication with Discord required!


!!! THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION !!!
This is intended for early access users wishing to play on 1.4, and is likely to be broken several times!

I will do my best to ensure that the mod stays compatible and issue updates as needed, especially for multiplayer and cross-mod compatibility.
Please report any issues -no matter how small- to the Steam workshop page, or reach out to me on the tModloader Discord (@CrazyContraption#0666)

We're also open to suggestions and feedback!
